# googleTrendApi

This project is an application of the google trend api (https://github.com/pat310/google-trends-api)

The goal is to gather the data that have marked the internet on one day. 

Thanks to the api, we can easily retrieve data on the most searched keywords/expressions of the day. By filtering the data and storing it in files I was able to use it.
So I coded a small nodeJs server on port 8888 with a script that allows to display trends in a particular form.

I let some data in the result folder. It was collected between the 20th and the 31th of October in US. 

I would like to make this thing more userfriendly and add some cool features.
